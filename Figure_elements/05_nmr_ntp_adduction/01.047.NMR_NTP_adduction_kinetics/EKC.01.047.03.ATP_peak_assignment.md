### Rationale
Want to measure NMR $k_{add}$ but having trouble with peak assignment. Will try to systematically piece together integral quantitation and predicted 1H NMR to determine correct peaks to quantify.

### ATP vs. 1-methyl-ATP
- Measured on March 27, 2023: 1 mM (nominal) ATP or 1 mM commercially ordered m1ATP (solid N1-Methyl-ATP Cat. no. NU-1027-5 from Jena Bioscience)
